I am a senior lecturer ("Dozent") and group leader at [Zuerich University of Applied Sciences ZHAW](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/university/), located in Winterthur, Switzerland. I am deputy director of ZHAW's [Centre for Artificial Intelligence CAI](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/cai/), and lead its Intelligent Vision Systems (IVS) research group. I am the scientific coordinator of the [PhD programme in Data Science](https://phd-data-science.ch/), a collaboration between ZHAW and University of Zurich.

My research focus is on AI/Deep Learning methods for Computer Vision, building Machine Learning Systems (MLOps), Trustworhy AI and applications of AI/Deep Learning in the Sciences. I teach lectures at the BSc and MSc level in computer science and data science.  

In a previous life, I performed fundamental research in Particle Physics at major international research Labs such as [CERN](https://home.cern/) (Geneva) and [DESY](http://www.desy.de/) (Hamburg). In 2012, I contributed to the experimental [discovery of the Higgs particle](https://home.cern/science/physics/higgs-boson) at CERN, whose theoretical prediction  was awarded with the [2013 Nobel Prize in Physics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2013/summary/). I obtained a PhD in physics from the University of Heidelberg in 2001.
