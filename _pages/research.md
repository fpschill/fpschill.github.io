## AI/ML Projects at ZHAW


### A data-driven solution that optimizes ankle-foot-orthopedic braces for children (OrthoSense) (2026-, Innosuisse)

OrthoSense by Leg&airy revolutionizes ankle-foot orthotics by turning subjective brace fitting into data- driven care. Embedded sensors capture pressure data, enabling AI driven biomechanical algorithms to tailor each brace’s shape and fit to the individual patient while enabling patients tracking.

### Antimicrobial Resistance Tracker (2025-, DIZH)

The goal of the project is to strengthen surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in animals and food products, with a focus on international travelers. The project will explore (and quantify the uncertainty of) using AI-based text and image mining techniques to extract data on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance from thousands of survey documents.

### SCRAI (2025-, DIZH Structure)

SCRAI brings responsible AI to the ground by bridging the gap between societal values and development of AI technology and solutions. The AI-BRIDGE Think-and-Do Tank will help organizations to exploit the potential of AI while complying with legal requirements and being compatible with societal expectations on ethical AI.

### SKACH (2022-, SERI)

In this project we use generative deep learning methods (GANs and VAEs) to produce realistic astronomical mock-observations of numerically simulated astrophysical objects, as they will be obseved by the Square Kilometre Array Telescope (SKA). This project contributes to the Swiss-wide activities for SKA of the SKACH Consortium.

### certAInty (2022-2025, Innosuisse)

Certification of AI Systems by an accredited body increases trust, accelerates adoption and enables their use for safety-critical applications. We develop a Certification Scheme comprising specific requirements, criteria, measures, and technical methods for assessing Machine Learning enabled Systems.

### AC3T (2022-2025, Innosuisse)

The project enables a novel, combined, adaptive cancer therapy combining tumor treating field and radiation therapy due to significantly improved static (3D) and time-resolved (4D) low dose Cone Beam Computer Tomography images based on artificial intelligence image reconstruction algorithms.

### OSR4H (2022-2023, Roche)

Development of a Proof of Concept for visual Open Set Recognition (OSR) algorithms applied to a Hematology task, the classification of white blood cells.

### DIR3CT (2020-2022, Innosuisse)

Project DIR3CT aims at improving the image quality of cone-beam CT images by deep learning the 3D reconstruction from X-ray images end-to-end. This enables a novel cone-beam CT product to be used during radiation therapy and will allow the use of these images for adaptive treatment.

### QualitAI (2018-2020, Innosuisse)

QualitAI researches and develops a device for automatic quality control of industrial products like e.g. cardial ballon catheters. This will be facilitated through innovation in the area of artificial intelligence, especially by analyzing camera images using  Deep Learning.
