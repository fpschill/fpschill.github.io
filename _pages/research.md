## AI/ML Projects at ZHAW


### certAInty (2022-)

Certification of AI Systems by an accredited body increases trust, accelerates adoption and enables their use for safety-critical applications. We develop a Certification Scheme comprising specific requirements, criteria, measures, and technical methods for assessing Machine Learning enabled Systems.

### SKACH (2022-)

In this project we use generative deep learning methods (GANs and VAEs) to produce realistic astronomical mock-observations of numerically simulated astrophysical objects, as they will be obseved by the Square Kilometre Array Telescope (SKA). This project contributes to the Swiss-wide activities for SKA of the SKACH Consortium.

### AC3T (2022-)

The project enables a novel, combined, adaptive cancer therapy combining tumor treating field and radiation therapy due to significantly improved static (3D) and time-resolved (4D) low dose Cone Beam Computer Tomography images based on artificial intelligence image reconstruction algorithms.

### OSR4H (2022-2023)

Development of a Proof of Concept for visual Open Set Recognition (OSR) algorithms applied to a Hematology task, the classification of white blood cells.

### DIR3CT (2020-2022)

Project DIR3CT aims at improving the image quality of cone-beam CT images by deep learning the 3D reconstruction from X-ray images end-to-end. This enables a novel cone-beam CT product to be used during radiation therapy and will allow the use of these images for adaptive treatment.

### QualitAI (2018-2020)

QualitAI researches and develops a device for automatic quality control of industrial products like e.g. cardial ballon catheters. This will be facilitated through innovation in the area of artificial intelligence, especially by analyzing camera images using  Deep Learning.

## Particle Physics with the CMS Experiment at CERN


### Higgs Boson Physics (2012-2014)


Search for the Higgs boson in associated WH->lnubb production mode; focus on boosted regime at large pT(H); 
use of jet sub-structure and jet energy regression algorithms; multi-variate analysis using NN/BDT. This channel contributed to the
[observation of the Higgs boson in 2012](https://home.cern/science/physics/higgs-boson), the prediction of which was awarded with the [Nobel Prize in Physics in 2013](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2013/summary/).
